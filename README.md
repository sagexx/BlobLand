# Random Password Gen

This password generator allows users to create strong, randomized passwords with a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers.

To use the password generator, click on the "Generate Password" button on the webpage, and the code prompts the user to choose the length of the password and which character sets to include. The user can select between including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers, with prompts for each option.

If the user inputs an invalid password length (less than 10 or greater than 128 digits) or an invalid value, the code displays an alert message and prompts the user again. Once the user has selected the desired password length and character sets, the code generates a random password and displays it on the webpage.
